# Read-Files
Reads in a file and outputs to new file in C++

This program opens and reads in a text file consisting of student names, their student IDs, and their year on different lines for each person. 
The names, IDs, and years are stored in three separate arrays. The program then opens an output file and writes the stored information to that file. 
The format of the output file consists of the names on the first lines, the IDs on the second line, and the years on the last line.
